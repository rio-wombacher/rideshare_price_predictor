# Rideshare Pricing Analysis
Analyzing rideshare data from Boston and creating predictive pricing models


Data from 2017 shows that in Boston alone, almost 100,000 rides a day were completed via Uber and Lyft[1], a number that is likely to have grown in the years since.  

I analyzed rideshare data from Boston for Uber and Lyft, along with corresponding weather conditions. I then created pricing models to identify which variables have the largest impact on price, and used the best model to help evaluate whether a given ride was a good deal or unusually expensive given the circumstances. I was motivated to do this project to help provide some insight into the variability in rideshare prices which, due to surge pricing, can often seem inconsistent and arbitrary at certain times when prices can fluctuate 10-20% in only a matter of minutes. Also, from firsthand experience, a couple of ill-timed rides in Boston can definitely hurt the bank account!
